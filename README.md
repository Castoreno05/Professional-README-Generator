# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

In this module you will be given the ability to generate a professional README.md

In the Intergrated Terminal for "index.js" run "node index.js". Then questions will prompt the user.

The information from the user input is passed into the README.md to fill the sections with content.

Once all of the questions are answered a README.md will generate and store into the "Develop" folder.
